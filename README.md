# ASP.NET-CORE-Web-App
#### Learning Path
In this learning journey I tackled the benefits of using APIs (a set of rules and protocols allowing apps to communicate with each other).
APIs not only provide a way for developers to access the functionality of another piece of software, such as a web service, and use that functionality in their own applications.
They also : 
- Simplify development ==> functionality of other software is accessible without having to understand the details of how that software works, saving time and effort when building new applications.
- Enable integration ==> allow different software applications to work together,  helping businesses integrate their systems and data and improving efficiency and productivity.

##### Objectives
- Describe the two model types of APIs in ASP.NET Core.
- Create Swagger documentation for an API by using Swashbuckle.
- Interact with an API by using the Swagger interface.

##### Approach
To simplify the learning process, the work was segmented into digestable units.

### Unit 01 #### ASP.NET Core APIs
ASP.NET Core supports two approaches to creating APIs: a controller-based approach and minimal APIs. A controller-based API is a traditional approach to building APIs in which each endpoint is mapped to a specific controller class. The controller handles the request, performs any necessary business logic, and returns a response.

##### Controller-based API
Controller classes that derive from ControllerBase.
